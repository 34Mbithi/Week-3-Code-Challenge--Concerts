# Week-3-Code-Challenge--Concerts

Week 3 Code Challenge - Concerts
This repository contains a Python project built with SQLAlchemy, designed to model and manage the domain of concerts, bands, and venues. It showcases how to implement and work with a relational database using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), with a particular focus on managing many-to-many relationships between Bands and Venues through Concerts. Additionally, it includes object relationship methods, aggregate methods, and an example for setting up migrations using Alembic.




This project models a concert domain where:
A Band has many Concerts.
A Venue has many Concerts.
A Concert belongs to both a Band and a Venue.





Domain Models
The three primary models in this project are Band, Venue, and Concert. These classes represent the data structure and relationships between the entities in the domain.

Band
Represents a musical band. A band can perform multiple concerts in different venues.
Attributes:
id: Primary key.
name: The name of the band (String).
hometown: The band's hometown (String).
Relationships:
concerts: A one-to-many relationship with Concert. A band can play multiple concerts.




Venue
Represents a location where concerts are held.
Attributes:
id: Primary key.
title: The name of the venue (String).
city: The city where the venue is located (String).
Relationships:
concerts: A one-to-many relationship with Concert. A venue can host multiple concerts.






Concert
Represents a concert, which connects a band and a venue at a particular date.
Attributes:
id: Primary key.
date: The date of the concert (String).
band_id: Foreign key to the Band model.
venue_id: Foreign key to the Venue model.






Relationships:
band: A many-to-one relationship to Band.
venue: A many-to-one relationship to Venue.




Relationships
The relationship between Band, Venue, and Concert is as follows:
A Band can have many Concerts.
A Venue can have many Concerts.
A Concert belongs to one Band and one Venue.
In essence, Concerts act as a junction table (or associative entity) to model the many-to-many relationship between Band and Venue. This setup allows querying concerts for a band, bands that performed at a venue, and other complex relationships efficiently.



Setting Up the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
SQLAlchemy
Alembic (for migrations)
A database engine (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)



You can run tests using a testing framework like pytest. Ensure you have a testing database to avoid modifying production data.
