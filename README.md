## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    - For Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - For macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2>=2.9.0 python-dotenv>=0.21.0
    ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    DB_HOST=your_database_host
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    DB_USER=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.



To create the database and tables, run the application:

bash

python debug.py
This will create a database.db file in the root directory and set up the required tables.
